<h2>What is blockchain?</h2>
A <a href="https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EB%B8%94%EB%A1%9D%EC%B2%B4%EC%9D%B8" target="_blank">blockchain</a>,[1][2][3] originally block chain,[4][5] is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography.
<p>[1][6] Each block typically contains a hash pointer as a link to a previous block,[6] a timestamp and transaction data.[7] By design, blockchains are inherently
resistant to modification of the data.</p>

<p style="margin-top:40px;"> The Harvard Business Review describes it as "an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties
 efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way."[8] For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively
  adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all
  subsequent blocks, which requires collusion of the network majority.</p>
